# NestJS CRUD API & CMS CODE TESTING

This project is a coding test to demonstrate a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using the NestJS framework. The API manages a Posts resource and uses SQLite as the database.

## Technologies Used & Criteria
* NextJS: use ShacdnUI for CMS. Simple without login, only form CRUD.
* NestJS: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
* SQLite: A file-based SQL database, lightweight and easy to set up for development.
* Git: A distributed version control system for tracking changes.
* Swagger / send us json postman file at the end of test.
* Running under latest node.

## CMS
use https://ui.shadcn.com for CMS template. Simple without login, only simple CRUD Form.

## API Endpoints
The API provides the following endpoints for managing Posts. With the field :
```
* Title.
* Slug.
* Content / Description.
* Active state.
* Publish date.
* And other things related to usual Posts type filed you want to added.
```
Set this API with GET,PUT,PATCH,DELETE Method.

## Objective
* Please add an issues and new branch to define the test task.
* Separate between CMS and API with different folder and different PORT.
* Feel free to explore your own way to define the Posts API approach.
